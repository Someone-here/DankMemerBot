# DankMemerBot
This is a python made bot for grinding coins on the infamous discord bot: DankMemer

All the files will be .py files which require python to be installed on your system to execute.

Some files also require the use of selenium webdriver.

The files also use pyautogui for automation.

There are two versions of the bot.

The first one uses coordinates so it will only work on some screens and the coords will have to be changed for other screens.
And it also has the logic of gambling coins if above a certain amount.

The second one uses selenium to access discord directly from the web, and then sends the commands to the DankMemer bot.
It does not have the gambling logic as it doesn't keep track of coins.
